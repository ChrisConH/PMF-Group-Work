## Asset Pricing 
Risk and return play an important role in making any investment decisions. As we know, the main focus of asset pricing theories is to determine the fundamental value of assets and there is a relation between this and an appropriate return. So, the focus of asset pricing theories is to determine this appropriate return. 
For this report, three U.S. stocks from different industries were selected, which are the following: Nike, Microsoft, and McDonald's Corporation. This assignment includes the last five years of monthly returns for the three individual stocks and the S&P500 stock index. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the relationship between asset returns and market. 

## Single-index model 
Determining efficient portfolios within an asset class can be achieved with the Single-index model. The market return is an aggregation of all individual asset returns traded in the stock market. The Single Index Model relates returns on each security to the returns on a common index, such as the S&P500 Stock Index.

### Methodology
The model suggested is:
Ri = αi + βiI + ei
Where:
Ri = expected return on security i
αi = intercept of a straight line or alpha coefficient, component proportional to the market index (βiS&P500j)
βi = slope of straight line or beta coefficient
I = expected return on index (S&P500j)
ei = error term with the mean of zero and a standard deviation which is a constant

This model is the basis for further investigation. As mentioned before, three stocks were selected, i = 1,...3, and 69 monthly returns observations j=1,...69.
Our purpose is to find αi and βi for the stocks of Nike, Microsoft, and McDonald's Corporation. 

## Individual Assets Returns
The stock returns of the past five years for Nike, Microsoft and McDonald's Corporation are the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# stock returns
R_stocks <- c("NKE", "MSFT", "MCD") %>%
tq_get(get = "stock.prices", from = "2016-01-01",
to = "2021-10-01") %>%
group_by(symbol) %>%
tq_transmute(select = adjusted,
mutate_fun = periodReturn,
period = "monthly",
col_rename = "R_stocks")
R_stocks
```

## S&P500
Concerning the S&P500, monthly returns for the past five years are:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# S&P500 monthly returns
R_market <- "^GSPC" %>%
tq_get(get = "stock.prices", from = "2016-01-01", to = "2021-10-01") %>%
tq_transmute(select = adjusted,
             mutate_fun = periodReturn,
              period = "monthly",
              col_rename = "R_market")
R_market
```

Here, the S&P500 returns are merged with the three stocks, Nike, Microsoft and McDonald's Corporation, into the same variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
R_stocks_market <- left_join(R_stocks, R_market, by = c("date" = "date"))
R_stocks_market
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# All models estimated at once.
R_capm <- R_stocks_market %>%
tq_performance(Ra = R_stocks,
Rb = R_market,
performance_fun = table.CAPM) %>%
select(symbol, Alpha, Beta, `R-squared`)
R_capm
```

From the above table one can observe the results for the single index model estimation for the three stocks. First, let's discuss the beta. There are stocks β from 0.5935 to 0.8628. This can be interpreted as a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. In other words, beta gives a sense of a stock's market risk compared to the greater market. Beta coefficient is a measure of sensitivity of a share price to movement in the market price. In this case, MCD has the lowest beta so it is less exposed to change in the S&P500, therefore, it can be said that MCD might be exposed to other risk factors, but not at all with the market, this point will be analyzed later in the report. On the other hand, stocks with high betas, as in our case, NKE are highly exposed to changes in the S&P500. Nevertheless, the beta of NKE is less than 1, which means it is less volatile than the whole market. If there was a β that is greater than 1, it would be more volatile than the market, which is not the case here. 

A deeper econometric analysis is needed to validate the above interpretations. All alphas are very close to zero. The R-squared shows what proportion of changes in the stock returns are explained by changes in the stock market, the 47% of MSFT stock return changes are explained by changes in the S&P500

Let's illustrate the previous results in a graphical way.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
R_stocks_market$symbol <- factor(R_stocks_market$symbol, levels =
unique(R_stocks_market$symbol))
